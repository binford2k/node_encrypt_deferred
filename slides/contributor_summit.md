~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* And now a shameless plug for an event that I'm working on
* Come see me in Budapest this June and learn more about deferred functions and other cool new tech!
* We'll be running another Project Month building up to it
* I'd love to see some projects impementing deferred functions
    * Or something backed by Bolt
    * Or even something using Lyra that Eric talked about earlier
* Keep an eye out, we'll be announcing details soon.
