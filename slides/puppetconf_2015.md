~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* So let's set the stage for my story.
* The first act happens in Puppetconf 2014 in San Francisco.
* Down in the bottom of that weird hotel, talking to people, vendors, users, etc.
* I noticed a recurring theme throughout the whole event
* Secrets, secrets, SECRETS!
* Everyone wanted to talk secret management
* Vault was like negative eight months old at this point

But with good reason. See, let's dig into a sneak peek into the innards of the Puppet Catalog.
